"Bit by bit the plant-form builds to emerge in blossom and fruit! This was a power that simply slept in the seed. The dry kernel holds and protects the dormant life; then it gushes, heaving up, lifts itself all at once out of the enveloping night." - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, The metamorphosis of plants
