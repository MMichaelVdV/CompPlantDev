# Computational methods in plant developmental biology

<div align="center"> "I wish, lovely friend, that I were able to
    Happily hand you at once the disentangling word! â€”   
Watch now and be transformed, how bit by bit the plant-form,
    Guided stepwise, builds to emerge in blossom and fruit!
Out of the germ it unfolds, the moment the still and fertile
    Lap of the earth has lovingly let it go out into life,
There where the charm of light, the holy eternal mover
    Now ushers in the most delicate structures of burgeoning leaves.
This was a power that simply slept in the seed; a prototype
    Lay there closed and curled up in itself inside the husk,
Leaf and taproot and seed, as yet half-formed and colorless;
    Thus the dry kernel holds and protects the dormant life,
Then it gushes, heaving up, trusting to milder moistures,
    Lifts itself all at once out of the enveloping night." 
-Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, The metamorphosis of plants </div>
